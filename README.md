## Running it
1. Save weights for use in the web app -> ```python generate_js_weights.py```
2. Save all the images needed -> ```python save_images_txt.py```

3. Start flask server ```python app.py```


## Sampling from the net's latent space
New images can be generated by sampling the autoencoder's latent space.

## Interpolating between images
Interpolation between images can be performed by linearly interpolating between the latent vectors of those images and then feeding that into the decoder part of the autoencoder.
